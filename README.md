This project involved picking a robust dataset and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key predictive factors contributing to diabetes using R and RStudio. Predictive models were developed using advanced analytics techniques, achieving significant accuracy in risk stratification. Advanced data analytics techniques were employed to interpret high-level information and insights from raw data, enhancing decision-making processes. The project culminated in a robust business report and a dynamic presentation of findings, showcasing strong data analytics and presentation skills.
